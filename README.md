------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Realm Information

- 1-60 [Live]: 3x Rates Progression Realm - 
Here on this realm you'll be able to get a head start on your leveling journey, with your level 60 character's and their gear remaining upon all progression from 1-90 over the next year or two! In order to remain true to our Blizzlike vision, raid releases will be staggered over time and we're going to leave Worgen, Goblin and Pandaren disabled until working at Blizzlike state.

"This gives everyone a chance to "get a head start" on our server and keep the progress you make with it! For the time being, Worgen/Goblin/Pandaren will be disabled to keep the realm Blizzlike. Upon our official release, this characters that reach level 60 *will* transfer over to our 1-100 realm!"

- 90-100 [Closed-Beta]: 3x Rates Realm - 
On our post 60 realm locked to only QA Rank and higher, you'll have a character start at level 60 testing all your favorite WoD content.
